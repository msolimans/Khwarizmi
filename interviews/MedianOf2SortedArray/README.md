# EXERCISE 2
# Find the median number of all values from two very large arrays of sorted integers. Assume
both arrays
# have the same large length = N.
# I like to see a solution of runtime faster than O(N)
#
# For example:
# Input: array_int1 = [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 51, 61, 71]
# array_int2 = [ 15, 25, 31, 86, 600, 700, 900]
#
# Output: median number = 45.5
